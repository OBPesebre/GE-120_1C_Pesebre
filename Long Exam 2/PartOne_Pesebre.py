1. Procedural programming includes repetitive processes as this does not utilizes function. Most of the time, every code or function needed for each step
is called out. On contrary, object-oriented programming lessens the tendency of the redundancy of codes. This is because it allows polymorphism and inheritance. In addition,
it also allow the usage of objects and encapsulation. For example, if we want to create a code for horizontal traverse, going through procedural programming may take up a long time.
This is because there is a need for the programmer to create a "function" for every line. On the other hand, object-oriented programming is more efficient for this case
because we can create a single function that can be utilized for every line by inheriting the attributes.

2. GUI enables geodetic engineers to create programs and applications that enable them to connect or interact with people. This is because GUI has certain features that
allows the users to input or interact with programs and applications. For instance, programmers created dms-dd and vice versa converter. Through the use of GUI, this app
permits the users to type or input the data that they want to be converted. This can be done through the help of text input or the keyboard. Moreover, there can be labels
included in the app using texts that may help the users further understand the function of the program. After typing the data, the users can click a button that will alert
the back-end that there is a calculation needed to be done. In short, GUI makes programs and applications complete.

3. Operation overloading is the method used to combine together operations in one function or method. This entails the usage of magic methods or dunders.

4. Inheritance is a process of avoiding redundancy in coding. This is because we can derive a class from another class and add some unique attributes afterwards. In other
words, we can create a child class from a parent class, which leads to class hierarchy. For example, we want to convert azimuth to bearing. The parent class can include
those angles that are within each quadrant. Meanwhile, the child class can be the ones that are along the north, east, south, or west direction. As an illustration, the 
parent class may contain functions that has an if-else statement wherein if the converted bearing is initially between 0 deg and 90 deg in terms of azimuth from the north,
then it will become North East. The child class can modify that and say that if the azimuth from the north inputted by the user is equal to 0 deg, then print due north.

5. Front-end contains most of the UI because this is where the user interact. The front-end is what the users see wherein they can input texts, click buttons, or read
texts. Moving forward, back-end contains models and the program functions. This acts upon the action done by the user. Moreover, it deals with the data stored in the
database. Speaking of database, it is the one that holds most of the data. For example, in a backsight calculator, the front-end has the texts "station occupied" and "station
sighted". Besides, it has text boxes that allow the users to type their data and buttons to trigger the calculation. After doing that, the back-end works on with the
necessary computations and give back the answer to the front-end to display and show it to the user. And, those data and calculations are saved and preserved in the database.
